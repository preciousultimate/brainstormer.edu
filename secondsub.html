Persia was ruled by one man. In Athens, however, all citiens helped to rule. Emboldenedby this participation, Athenians were prepared to die for their city-state. Perhaps this was the secret of the remarkable victory at the marathon, the Persians tried to fool some Greek city-states by claiming to have come in peace. The frightened city of Delos refused to believe this. Not wanting to abet the conquest of Greece, they fled from their city and did not return until the Persians had left. They were wise, for the president next conquered the city of Eritrea and captured its people.


TinyAthens stood alone against Persia. The Athenian people to their sanctuaries. There they prayed for deliverance. They asked their gods to expedite their victory. The Athenians refurbished their weapons and moved to the plan of Marathon where their little band would meet the Persians. At the last moment, soldiers from Plataea reinforced the Athenian troops.

Question 23
</span>
May in Ayemenem is a hot, brooding month. The days are long and humid. The river shrinks and black crows gorge on bright mangoes in still, dust green trees. Red bananas ripen. Jackfruits burst. Dissolute blue bottles hum vacuously in the fruity air. Then they stun themselves against clear windowpanes and die, fatly baffled in the sun. The nights are clear but suffused with sloth and sullen expectations.

But by early June the southwest monsoon breaks and there are three months of wind and water with short spells of sharp, glittering sunshine that thrilled children snatch to play with. The countryside turns an immodest green. Boundaries blur as tapioca fences take root and bloom. Brick walls turn mossgreen. Pepper vines snake up electric poles. Wild creepers burst through laterite banks and spilt across the flooded roads. Boats ply in the bazaars. And small fish appear in the puddles that fill the PWD potholes on the highways. It was raining when Rahel came
back to Ayemenem.

Slanting silver ropes slammed into loose earth, ploughing it up like gunfire. The old house on the hill wore its steep, gabled roof pulled over its ears like a low hat. The walls, streaked with moss, had grown soft and bulged a little with dampness that seeped up from the ground. The wild, overgrown garden was full of the whisper and scurry of small lives.In the undergrowth, a rat snake rubbed itself against a glistening stone. Hopeful yellow bullfrogs cruised the scummy pond for mates. A drenched mongoose flashed across the leaf-strewn driveway. The house itself looked empty. The doors and windows were locked. The front verandah bare. Unfurnished.

But the sky blue Plymouth with chrome tail fins was still parked outside, and inside, Baby Kochamma was still alive. She was Rahel's baby grand aunt, her grandfather's younger sister. Her name was really Navomi, Navomi Ipe, but everybody called her Baby. She became Baby Kochamma when she was old enough to be an aunt. Rahel hadn't come to see her, though.
Neither niece nor baby grandaunt laboured under any illusions on that account. Rahel had come to see her brother, Estha. They were two-egg twins. "Dizygotic' doctors called them. Born from separate but simultaneously fertilized eggs. Estha Esthappen-was the older by 18 minutes.

Question 45

Read the following passage and answer the questions below:

Christopher Marlowe, the son of Marlowe who is described as the clerk of St Mary's in the city of Canterbury, was born in 1564. He received his early education at The King's School in that city. He took the degrees of B.A. and M.A. in 1583 and 1587 respectively from Cambridge University. He started writing poems and became a renowned dramatist in the Admiral's Company.

Marlowe is known as one of the university wits, a group of dramatists along with Robert Greene, Thomas Nash, and George Peele. Marlowe is considered the greatest precursor to Shakespeare. When Marlowe came upon the English stage, the nature of drama was undeveloped. The verses in the dramas were lifeless. But Marlowe gave English drama an appropriate meter, diction, and method. It is really a matter of speculation what kind of greatness he would have achieved if his life had not been terminated (C++) in a duel after a brawl in a tavern (inn).

The literary life of Marlowe had a short span, from 1587 to 1593. During this period, he wrote five plays which were all tragedies as he had no comic vein. His tragedies like Dr Faustus, The Jew of Malta, and Edward Il are rated as some of the best works of the Elizabethan age. He also wrote an unfinished poem Hero and Leander and translated some parts of Ovid's (a Roman Poet) elegies.

Marlowe's subjects are mostly heroic which appeals to the imagination of the play-goers. His heroes epitomize the spirit of the Renaissance. Each of them embodies a passion and tries to achieve lies in his development of the blank verse. He put it at any cost. But Marlowe's chief contribution aside from the old rhyming lines then employed in the plays and used blank verse. Thus, the language of drama was brought closer to real life and drama was made ready for Shakespeare (1564-1616) to improve upon it. It is rightly said, "No Marlowe, no Shakespeare".

                            Question 1
                            </span>
Theatre in the recent past used to be a very popular art in traditional African society. It used to be a point of intersection where members of the community not only cometo entertain themselves, 'but join heads together'. In the traditional context of African drama, therefore, theatre was popular and respectable institution which preserved the people's culture and tradition. Theatre was popular with the people because it emphasized community participation, peace and progress. The presentations focused on the people's lives, their aspirations, fears, and hopes. But today, the situation is different. Theatre is becoming very unpopular.

Africa of the present age is pre-occupied with many problems yearning for immediate solutions. The continent is facing hydra-head challenges - challenges on the political, social, and economic scenes. In a world where Science and Technology are seen as the solutions to these problems, little attention is paid to the arts. Literature generally, and drama in particular is often rated very low on the utility-scale. Many Africa today look at drama and theatreas a mere thing of fun, a joke so to say.


Elitism is another barrier that militates against the appreciation of theatreas a communal art. Folktheatre is appreciated by a negligible number of people, contemporary focus is on literary theatre. Unfortunately, literary theatre only pretends to serve the interest of its society while in reality, it has a foreign audience in mind. The use of European and American theatricalconventions by our academic playwrights can bear witness to this anomaly.

<span>literary dramas 
in Africa are written in foreign languages which are not understood by many Africans. The question often asked is 
</span>The popularity of the literary African theatre is further marred by the medium of communication as most whether the artist should climb down to the level of his community of stay at his exalted height and wait for the community to gradually move up to him.

Question 6
</span>
The financing of the university will always be a vexatious problem not only because of the need for it to maintain a level of independence that allows for the thriving of intellectual pursuit but also for the size of the funding that is required to maintain an acceptable level ofinfrastructurein a modern university. The experience of the Nigerian university in recent years has, in this regard, been almost alarming. The funding levels requited constitute sufficient reasons for diversifying the sources. Even if the government was in a position on its own to meet all of the university's financial requirements, I consider it desirable that every effort be made to reduce such contribution in the interest of university autonomy. I also hold the view that theuniversity should seek to become dependent, in a substantial way, on funds generated from within. In other words, the sources of funding the university should be diversified as much as possible. Based on this principle, Â·we can identify four sources - government, industry, students, and individual philanthropists. I must add quickly that each source has its own set of problems in its continuous interaction with the university, which ought to be addressed here.

Of all the four major sourcesof financing university education mentioned above, contribution through fees from the students involves intricate issues of specialconcern If government gives as an expression of its obligation to promote the general welfare of society if industry gives in order to enhance its chances of procurement of needed human information and material resources, as well as enhance its social responsibility if the general public gives as an indication of voluntary support for a worthy social cause, students (and by inference, their parents) should give in order to purchase an economic good for meeting their own felt need in the expectation that they will be satisfied with the product purchased.

The financing of the university will always be a vexatious problem not only because of the need for it to maintain a level of independence that allows for the thriving of intellectual pursuit but also for the size of the funding that is required to maintain an acceptable level ofinfrastructurein a modern university. The experience of the Nigerian university in recent years has, in this regard, been almost alarming. The funding levels requited constitute sufficient reasons for diversifying the sources. Even if the government was in a position on its own to meet all of the university's financial requirements, I consider it desirable that every effort be made to reduce such contribution in the interest of university autonomy. I also hold the view that theuniversity should seek to become dependent, in a substantial way, on funds generated from within. In other words, the sources of funding the university should be diversified as much as possible. Based on this principle, Â·we can identify four sources - government, industry, students, and individual philanthropists. I must add quickly that each source has its own set of problems in its continuous interaction with the university, which ought to be addressed here.

Of all the four major sourcesof financing university education mentioned above, contribution through fees from the students involves intricate issues of specialconcern If government gives as an expression of its obligation to promote the general welfare of society if industry gives in order to enhance its chances of procurement of needed human information and material resources, as well as enhance its social responsibility if the general public gives as an indication of voluntary support for a worthy social cause, students (and by inference, their parents) should give in order to purchase an economic good for meeting their own felt need in the expectation that they will be satisfied with the product purchased.

Question 10
</span>
Read the Passage carefully and answer the questions that follow.

The term Mass Communication occurs when information is disseminated to a relatively large number of people in different places. it should be seen as the same thing with talking face to face with someone else. With mass communication, there is no answer, smile, laugh or lock of surprise. the people who receive the message are as far away from the source of the message as far away as you are from the announcers on the radio or from the newscasters on television, or from the writer of a column in the local newspaper.

There are three identifiable means of errors in mass communication. There is one done through the printed words, books, magazine and newspapers. The other is primarily radio, but also records and tape recordings. Also, it can be done through a combination of sound and pictures as in television, films and the more recently popular video tape.

Together, they are referred to as the mass media.

All media can be used to inform and entertain. However, there are coverts roles played. It may be to educate as in school broadcast. Again, the aim may be to persuade as when the media are used by advertisers or for political broadcasts. The media are often in strong position to influence public opinion because they select the topics to be presented and can stress the importance of one issue over the other.

The mass media have, in recent times, come under acerbic criticism. Many presenters have become not only conscientized but also immensely concerned about the possible effects that science of violence and bad behavior may have on their children. More worrisome are the potential danger of political and commercial propaganda.

The term Mass Communication occurs when information is disseminated to a relatively large number of people in different places. it should be seen as the same thing with talking face to face with someone else. With mass communication, there is no answer, smile, laugh or lock of surprise. the people who receive the message are as far away from the source of the message as far away as you are from the announcers on the radio or from the newscasters on television, or from the writer of a column in the local newspaper.

There are three identifiable means of errors in mass communication. There is one done through the printed words, books, magazine and newspapers. The other is primarily radio, but also records and tape recordings. Also, it can be done through a combination of sound and pictures as in television, films and the more recently popular video tape.

Together, they are referred to as the mass media.

All media can be used to inform and entertain. However, there are coverts roles played. It may be to educate as in school broadcast. Again, the aim may be to persuade as when the media are used by advertisers or for political broadcasts. The media are often in strong position to influence public opinion because they select the topics to be presented and can stress the importance of one issue over the other.

The mass media have, in recent times, come under acerbic criticism. Many presenters have become not only conscientized but also immensely concerned about the possible effects that science of violence and bad behavior may have on their children. More worrisome are the potential danger of political and commercial propaganda.

                            </span>

In order to approach the problem of anxiety in play, let us consider the problem of anxiety in play, let us consider the activity of building and destroying a tower. Many a mother thinks that her little son is in a 'destructive stage' or even has a 'destructive personality' because after building a big, big tower, the boy cannot follow her advice to leave the tower for Daddy to see, but instead must kick it and make it collapse. The almost manic pleasure with which children watch the collapse in a second of the product of long play-labour has puzzled many, especially since the child does not appreciate it at all if his tower falls by accident or by a helpful uncle’s hand. He, the builder, must destroy it himself. This game, I should think, arises from the not so distant experience of sudden falls at the very time when standing upright on wobbly legs afforded a new and fascinating perspective on existence. The child who consequently learns to make a tower 'stand up' enjoys causing the same tower to waver and collapse; in addition to the active mastery over a previously passive event, it makes one feel stronger to know that there is somebody weaker ----and towers, unlike little sister, can't cry and call, 'Mummy!'

According to this passage, it gives the child great pleasure



<span>
A)
</span>
for Daddy to see the tower he has built
<span>
B)
</span>
to destroy the tower himself
<span>
C)
</span>
to see his tower accidentally destroyed
<span>
D)
</span>
to be helped to destroy the tower

Question 6
</span>
A wolf, seeing a lamb drinking from a river, wanted to find a pretext for devouring him, He stood higher up the stream and accused the lamb of muddying the water so that he could not drink. The lamb said that he drank only the tip of his tongue and that in any case he was standing lower down the river, and could not possible disturb the water higher When this excuse failed him, the wolf said: 'Well, last year you insulted my father.' "I wasn't even born then replied the lamb. 'You are good at finding answer' said the wolf, 'but what do you mean by taking up so much of the path where I am walking?' The lamb, frightened at the wolf's angry tone and terrible aspect, told him, with all due submission, that he could not conceive how his walking on such a wide path could occasion him any inconvenience. 'What!' exclaimed the wolf, seemingly in great anger and indignation. 'You are as impudent as your father who seized me by the throat last year and caused me to be kept in a cage for three months'. 'If you will believe me,' said the lamb, 'my parents are poor simple creatures who live entirely by green stuff, we are none of us hunters of your species.' Ah! I see it's no use talking to you,' said the wolf, drawing up close to him. 'it runs in the blood of your family to hate us wolves, and therefore,as we have come so conveniently together, I'll just pay off a few of your forefathers scores before we part.' So saying, he leapt at the lamb from behind and garotted him. Adapted from Bennet. C.H(1978)

The lamb said that he drank only the tip of his tongue and that in any case he was standing lower down the river, and could not possible disturb the water higher When this excuse failed him, the wolf said: 'Well, last year you insulted my father.' "I wasn't even born then replied the lamb. 'You are good at finding answer' said the wolf, 'but what do you mean by taking up so much of the path where I am walking?' The lamb, frightened at the wolf's angry tone and terrible aspect, told him, with all due submission, that he could not conceive how his walking on such a wide path could occasion him any inconvenience.

Question 7

<span>
Read the passage carefully and answer the question that follows.
</span>

Curiosity is as clear and definite as any of our urges. We wonder what is in a sealed telegram or in a letter which someone else is absorbed or what is being said in the telephone booth or in low conversation. This inquisitiveness is vastly stimulated by jealousy. Suspicion or any hint that we ourselves are directly or indirectly involved in. But there appears to be a fair amount of personal interest in other people's affairs even when they do not concern us except as a mystery to be unravelled or a tale to be told. The reports of a divorce suit will have news 'value' for many weeks, They constitute a story like a novel, a play or a moving picture. This is not an example of pure curiosity. However, since we readily identify ourselves with others' their joys and despair then become our own concern.

Curiosity is as clear and definite as any of our urges. We wonder what is in a sealed telegram or in a letter which someone else is absorbed or what is being said in the telephone booth or in low conversation. This inquisitiveness is vastly stimulated by jealousy. Suspicion or any hint that we ourselves are directly or indirectly involved in. But there appears to be a fair amount of personal interest in other people's affairs even when they do not concern us except as a mystery to be unravelled or a tale to be told. The reports of a divorce suit will have news 'value' for many weeks, They constitute a story like a novel, a play or a moving picture. This is not an example of pure curiosity. However, since we readily identify ourselves with others' their joys and despair then become our own concern.

Question 38
</span>
Malnutrition has been described as a tragedy of great magnitude. WHO (World Health Organisation) declares that it is an accomplice in at least half of the 10.4 million child deaths each year. Malnutrition covers a wide range of illness from under-nourishment due to a lack of one or more nutrients such as vitamin and mineral deficiencies to obesity and other diet-related chronic diseases. However, Protein Energy Malnutrition (PEM) is by far the lethal form of malnutrition. Malnutrition is not restricted to children. It casts long shadows in the developing world according to WHO.

Industrialized countries are not free from the scourge of malnutrition as about 11 million people suffer from it. Malnutrition is caused by a deficiency in the intake of nutrients by the cells of the body and it is usually triggered by a combination of factors, an insufficient intake of proteins, calories, vitamins and minerals and frequent infections. Illnesses such as diarrhea, measles, malaria, and respiratory diseases that the body heavily and cause loss of nutrients. They reduce appetite and food intake thus contributing to malnutrition.

Children are at a greater risk of suffering malnutrition. This is because they are in a period of rapid growth that increases the demand for calories and proteins. For Similar reasons pregnant and nursing women are easily prone to malnutrition.

Frequently the baby’s problem begins even before birth. If a mother is undernourished or malnourished before and during pregnancy, the baby will have low weight. Then early weaning, poor feeding habits and lack of hygiene can bring malnutrition. Malnutrition wreaks havoc on the body particularly that of a child and various studies have shown that poor growth in the child is associated with impaired mental development and poor scholastic and intellectual performance. A report from united state calls these effects the most serious long term results of malnutrition. For children who survived malnutrition the aftermath can linger on into adulthood.

Question 7
</span>
Like all reptiles, snakes are cold blooded, or more correctly, ectothermic - they cannot produce their own body heat; instead, they rely on the sun to heat their bodies. Because they do not rely on energy from food to generate body heat, snakes can survive on an extremely meager diet. some wait for months between successive meals, and a few survive by eating a large meal just once or twice a year. When they do eat, snakes swallow their prey whole rather than biting off small piece. Many snakes have specialized jaws that enable them to swallow animals that are far larger than their own heads. Although uncommon, some snakes, such as the African rock python, have been observed eating animals as large as an antelope or a small cow.

With over two thousand five hundred species belonging to more than ten families, snakes are a large and successful groups. They owe much of this success to their versatility - snakes occupy habitat ranging from underground burrows to the top of the tree, to ocean depths as great as one hundred and fifty meters. They are found on every continent except Antarctica, and although they are most abundant in tropical areas, many survive in regions marked by extreme cold. The only places without snakes are parts of the polar regions and isolated islands, such as the Republic of Ireland and New-Zealand as opposed to places in Nigeria like Plateau and Gombe States in the Northern part where there is a large population of snakes.

Question 12
</span>
Political change and social transformation in the form of revolutions have radically altered the course of human civilization and history. Today, the world is witnessing political and social changes arising from the desire of people all over the globe for greater freedom and a voice in the way they are governed and a better standard of living. Pan of these struggles and processes have become more pronounced in the Third World since the end of the East-West cold War in the late 1980's, and in the face of the challenges being posed by the ongoing process of globalization.

While political and social changes may appear to be distinct phenomena, they are analytically inseparable. Political and social changes refer to alteration or transformations in human behavior, norms and politico-social institutions. Such changes are often a collective response to the need to change, or as a tacit recognition of a shift in the prevalent power relations in the society. Therefore, the coming to power of a new set of rulers, or the establishment of new structure and processes of governance broadly typifies socio-political changes.

It is important to note that changes can either be positive or negative. In most cases, political and social changes are caused by certain factors or reasons. This push people to collectively organize themselves to struggle for a change in the existing power relations. Another reason is to capture political power in the hope of making life better for the generality of the people.

Question 13
</span>
Like all reptiles, snakes are cold blooded, or more correctly, ectothermic - they cannot produce their own body heat; instead, they rely on the sun to heat their bodies. Because they do not rely on energy from food to generate body heat, snakes can survive on an extremely meager diet. some wait for months between successive meals, and a few survive by eating a large meal just once or twice a year. When they do eat, snakes swallow their prey whole rather than biting off small piece. Many snakes have specialized jaws that enable them to swallow animals that are far larger than their own heads. Although uncommon, some snakes, such as the African rock python, have been observed eating animals as large as an antelope or a small cow.

With over two thousand five hundred species belonging to more than ten families, snakes are a large and successful groups. They owe much of this success to their versatility - snakes occupy habitat ranging from underground burrows to the top of the tree, to ocean depths as great as one hundred and fifty meters. They are found on every continent except Antarctica, and although they are most abundant in tropical areas, many survive in regions marked by extreme cold. The only places without snakes are parts of the polar regions and isolated islands, such as the Republic of Ireland and New-Zealand as opposed to places in Nigeria like Plateau and Gombe States in the Northern part where there is a large population of snakes.
